bikeshare.csv. 

This file contains data related to number of riders (casual, members, and total) for each hour, compared to stats for that time, such as temperature, windspeed. the file bikeshare.txt will explain it in more detail.

Question 1. Explore the data in both hourly and daily counts. You'll need to aggregate by day to generate the daily data.
Question 2. Visualise the relationships between the ridership and different features.

Answer: Q1 and Q2 are done In assignment code file

Question 3. Explain which features seem to be the strongest indicators for each type of ridership (casual and noncasual). Do 4. certain features come off as better tells for one over the other?
Answer: The time of the day and the day of the week have strong influence on casual and noncasual riderships. 


Question 4. Summarise your results.

Answer:
- casual users ride more on the weekends
- register users ride more during the week

- registered riders ride mostly during rush hours
- casual riders like to ride in the afternoon

- All riders rider more in summer than in any other seasons
- Riders aren't like to ride when the temperature drop below 8 celcius, or when it's too windy or too humid

Question 5. Extra: Business application. Given this information, what suggestions could be made to improve the ridership program? Consider this open field, since we only have aggregated stats and not individual ridership here.

Answer:
Tasks in terms of priority:
a. Ensure there are on average 300 bikes between 8am - 7pm.
b. To maximize profit, ensure around 800 ~ 1000 bicycles between 8-9am and 4-7pm 
c. Tuesday to Friday have higher daily rider volumnes, ensure 200 min bikes daily in Summer and Fall
d. Maintenance tasks can be done during winter. around 100 - 200 bikes are sufficient to accomdate riders
