## Current "What I do during the day" status (work, student, mine bitcoins, etc)
A recent grad, I am currently reading Head First Statistics.
In my spare time, I look for data science internships that are open to hire candidates who don't have a MS/PHD. 

## A few examples of data you're interested in working with, or have worked with in the past
Luke Dubois' (an amazing genius) data mining experiment on online dating has inspired me to learn data science. (http://music.columbia.edu/~luke/projects/index.shtml?id=perfect)
I tried to web scrap match.com but with unsuccessful attempts.
I am also interested in learning how to visualize geospatial data.

## Why you signed up for the data science course
I am obsessed with data. I hope to live and breath them. 

## An interesting blog post or website that is data oriented that you recently read or found.
My awesome D3 project that shows parents the best and worst schools in New York City.
